# Excel Formulae & Functions 
## Operators :
The operations allowed in excel are mentioned below with some examples-
- add
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = A1 + B1 + ...
  ```
- subtract
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = A1 - B1 - ...
  ```
- multiply
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = A1 * B1 * ...
  ```
- division
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = A1 / B1 / ...
  ```
  
> The limitation of above is that for large number of cells we would have to type a lot. Instead we use a function in that case.

## Formulae :
- sum()
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = sum(B1,B2,B3...)
    OR
    = sum(B1:B3)
  ```
- min()
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = min(B1,B2,B3...)
    OR
    = min(B1:B10)
  ```
- count()
  ```text
  Counts no of cells, cell will be calculated as :
    = count(B1:C5)
  ```
 - counta()
  ```text
  Counts number of non empty cells, cell will be calculated as :
    =
  ```
 - average()
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = average(B1:B10)
  ```
 - concat()
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = concat(B3,C9)
  ```
 - current time
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = now()
  ```
 - median()
  ```text
  cell will be calculated as :
    = median(D1:G40)
  ```
